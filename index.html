    <p>South Africa is a diverse and vibrant country located at the southern tip of Africa. It is known for its rich cultural
    heritage, stunning landscapes, and complex history. The country has 11 official languages and a population of over 60
    million people. South Africa is often called the “Rainbow Nation” because of its multicultural society.
    
    Its history includes ancient indigenous cultures, European colonization (first by the Dutch, then the British), and a
    long struggle against apartheid—a system of racial segregation that lasted from 1948 to 1994. The country transitioned
    to democracy in 1994 when Nelson Mandela became its first Black president.
    
    Today, South Africa is a constitutional democracy with three capital cities: Pretoria (administrative), Cape Town
    (legislative), and Bloemfontein (judicial). It has a mix of modern cities, rural villages, wildlife parks, and
    coastlines. The economy is one of the largest in Africa, driven by mining, agriculture, manufacturing, andtourism.</p>

    <p>Gauteng is South Africa’s smallest province by land size but the most densely populated and economically powerful. It is

    and industrial heart, the province also offers cultural gems like the Apartheid Museum and Constitution Hill. Gauteng
    means “Place of Gold,” a name that reflects its origins during the gold rush era.</p>
