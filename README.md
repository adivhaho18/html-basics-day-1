# South African Provinces – Day 1 HTML Project

This beginner-friendly webpage is a simple, clean layout that introduces all **nine provinces of South Africa** with navigation, brief summaries, and images. It was built using only **HTML5** as part of my daily web development learning journey, aimed at mastering the basics of web structure, content organization, and internal page linking.

## 🔥 Key Features
- One-page scrollable layout with `nav` for quick jumps to each province.
- Informative descriptions of each province with links to Wikipedia for deeper exploration.
- Embedded images for each province’s flag or emblem.
- Semantic HTML tags (`<nav>`, `<section>`, `<h1>` to `<h2>`, `<a>`, etc.)
- Beginner-friendly structure perfect for hosting static content.

## 📚 What I Learned
- How to structure an HTML5 page using `<!DOCTYPE html>` and `<head>`/`<body>` tags.
- How to use anchor links to navigate within the same page using `id` attributes.
- Embedding and displaying images with `alt` attributes for accessibility.
- Organizing content in a clean, readable structure for educational use.
